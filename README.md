#Reddito
In this project I created a clone of the website Reddit. The website that I created allows users to login and then they can create
posts which contain either text, a video, a photo or any combination of the three. There are three main html pages for this
website. A simple register page which allows a user to register as a user. A "frontpage" which a diaplays 10 user posts at a time.
And a comments page for each post where users can comment and read other's comments about a post. Both the posts and the comments
display in an order which is based off of user votes.
